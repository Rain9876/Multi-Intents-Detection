1370,The COVID-19 hit me hard and lost a job but I was drawing benefits but it was not enough to pay on my credit and destroyed even worse. What I can't understand. I have paid of a mortgage on a 2000sq.ft home on two acres with a pool. I raised three girls and bought cars and paid them off also paid my bills.  Also two of my daughters have a College Degree one of them has a Master's. Went through a divorce three years ago and there not cheap but got custody of my youngest daughter which goes to A&M now. My point is I had to get some personal loans not even $5000.but COVID hit and I couldn't pay my dues. Now I hear people are twice as in depth then me getting help because it's over 10grand.  I can't even get another loan because I have delinquent marks on my credit for not paying. Again they don't look at the good things I have accomplished I am just a number in the system and they advertise all this help to help you but the bottom line is they try to take your money at a very high interest. I know I'm good for the money and will pay my dues like I had before but now it has gotten worse and in reality they don't care for a person that's actually suffering and help the rich and the government is helping people who take advantage over the money also the immigrants I try and get denied.

I've used you in the past for me and my children and had great results. 

My Fico score was in the 800's and my credit card changed to paperless. My credit card expired and I was in the hospital and I didn't 
Know about a late notice. I hadn't had a late notice for over 10 to 15 years. This last attempt by [LOCATION_1] was terrible. I don't mind paying but your results have been terrible. Please call me to solve this late notice.

With the exception of being diligent about debiting my money from my bank account, your company did not stay true to your word in helping me.  An upstanding business would
 have offered a credit of some type or even something along the lines of don't pay us until we see one thing come off but not [LOCATION_1] .... just a real quick sorry you are not happy and bye bye.

Does your firm deal with bank fraud?
On [DATE_1].  My bank account at [ORGANIZATION_1] was hacked and the individuals were able to do 9 digital reversals on bills I paid from [DATE_2] to [DATE_3]. The bank never notified me nor the [ORGANIZATION_2] on this matter( on [DATE_4] while at [ORGANIZATION_3] my card was declined while trying to buy food a notice was sent to my phone from the [ORGANIZATION_2]. But two days later when they hacked my account nothing was done when this activity was started.
They went after rent payments, my auto loan payments on one account and the other they went after my credit card.
On [DATE_5] I was notified by the credit card company by letter stating my cards were frozen due to fraudulent activity. I called them , the main card was paid off and digitally reversed putting it in a $[MONEY_1] - . I called [ORGANIZATION_4] and they told I should have been notified, but didn't know why I wasn't . I told them I never authorize any of these transactions, I wanted them stopped now!  They told me they had no idea who did it and it was done on a computer somewhere. Accused me of this . I  was with [ORGANIZATION_5] fir over 10 yrs .  [LOCATION_1] were notified and we went to the [OCCUPATION_1] because I had a eviction notice telling me I owed $[MONEY_2] back rent that I requested returned.
